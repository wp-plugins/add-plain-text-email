Because it decreases the chance of your *legit* email being marked as being spam and thus landing (disappearing) in spam folders.

= Will this mess up my HTML email? =
No, the plugin does not affect the HTML message of emails. 

= Will the people I send email to notice? =
No, 99% of all email clients will just show the HTML version of the email.

The other 1% can't properly display HTML and will show the plain text email. Without this plugin, they would have had nothing to show.
